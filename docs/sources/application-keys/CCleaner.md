## (App)Program Name

These entries indicate programs that are not part of the default set of enabled
Cleaning Rules, and whether they should be cleaned.

Note: Making an entry of "App(Your Program)]=true" will not allow CCleaner to
clean it, as you would instead need to use the methods listed here.

True = Checkbox selected when you start CCleaner.
False = Checkbox cleared when you start CCleaner.

Known Cleaning Rules:

* (App)Cookies, contains "True" if the cookies should be cleaned;
* (App)Delete Index.dat files
* (App)History
* (App)Last Download Location
* (App)Other Explorer MRUs
* (App)Recent Documents
* (App)Recently Typed URLs
* (App)Run (in Start Menu)
* (App)Temporary Internet Files
* (App)Thumbnail Cache

## IncludeX (e.g. Include1, Include2)

Custom files or folders that should be included in cleaning

[PATH|FILE]|Path|Filename

## ExcludeX (e.g. Exclude1, Exclude2)

Custom files or folders that should be excluded from cleaning.

[REG|PATH|FILE]|Path|Filename

## FinderIncludeX (e.g. FinderInclude1, FinderInclude2)

Drives or folders CCleaner to use when searching for duplicate files.

PATH|PATH\|Filetype|[RECURSE]

## FinderIncludeStates

Whether the checkboxes have been checked or unchecked for folders referenced
by FinderIncludeX.

0 = Cleared
1 = Selected

For example, if there are three FinderIncludeX statements, you can specify the
checked/cleared status using the pipe symbol:

FinderIncludeStates=1|0|1 would check the first and last items, and the middle
one would be unchecked.
